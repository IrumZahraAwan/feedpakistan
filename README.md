# Feed Pakistan
## Tackling food wastage
According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), developing countries waste 40 percent food items. Around 1.3 billon tonnes of food is wasted annually all over the world.

The difference in food consumption of the rich and the poor is troubling - the rich having too much and the poor having none. There is a lot of food wasted on a daily basis at weddings and buffets. Instead of wasting all this food, it could be donated to social welfare organizations that work for the less privileged.

Feed Pakistan provides a platform as an enabler to provide communication between different parties i.e. the institutions donating the food and institutions taking the food to feed the needy.

In addition to this, a social awareness campaign will also be started to educate the people on the need for this, especially the owners of the hotels/restaurants/bakeries etc. as to how they can prevent the food from being wasted and help the less privileged in the process.
